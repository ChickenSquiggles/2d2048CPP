# 2d 2048 C++
## I recreated 2048 in c++, using the SDL2 engine, along with SDL2 Image. If you want to build this project yourself, both will have to be installed and included in directories for visual C++.

# Pre built
## I have included a zip with a pre-built version of the 2048 game. Make sure to keep the .dll's in the same directory as it, or else it will not work (because of sdl2 reasons idk).
