# 2d 2048 C++
## I recreated 2048 in c++, using the SDL2 engine, along with SDL2 Image. If you want to build this project yourself, both will have to be installed and included in directories for visual C++.

# Pre built
## I have included a zip with a pre-built version of the 2048 game. Make sure to keep the .dll's and assets folder in the same directory as the .exe, or else it will not work (because of sdl2 reasons idk).
